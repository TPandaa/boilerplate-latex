	abstract = {In 1973, Victor Klee posed the following question: How many guards are necessary, and how many are sufficient to patrol the paintings and works of art in an art gallery with n walls?This wonderfully naïve question of combinatorial geometry has, since its formulation, stimulated a plethora of fun papers, surveys and a book, most of them written in the last twentyfive years. Several variations of the original Art Gallery Problem have appeared, and continue to appear in the literature. In this talk, we will present some recent work motivated by the following problem.Experience dictates that while trying to locate the best location for a wireless within a building, the main factor that attenuates the signal of a wireless modem, is the number of walls that a signal has to cross. Thus we call a wireless modem (from now on a modem) a k-modem if the signal it transmits is capable of crossing k-walls of a building, and still provide a strong enough signal.A generalization of Klee’s question is thus: How many k-modems are necessary, and how many are sufficient to cover the interior of an art gallery with n-walls? For k = 0, our problem reduces to the original Art Gallery Problem.},

	abstract = {Discrete geometry is a relatively new development in pure mathematics, while computational geometry is an emerging area in applications-driven computer science. Their intermingling has yielded exciting advances in recent years, yet what has been lacking until now is an undergraduate textbook that bridges the gap between the two. Discrete and Computational Geometry offers a comprehensive yet accessible introduction to this cutting-edge frontier of mathematics and computer science. This book covers traditional topics such as convex hulls, triangulations, and Voronoi diagrams, as well as more recent subjects like pseudotriangulations, curve reconstruction, and locked chains. It also touches on more advanced material, including Dehn invariants, associahedra, quasigeodesics, Morse theory, and the recent resolution of the Poincaré conjecture. Connections to real-world applications are made throughout, and algorithms are presented independently of any programming language. This richly illustrated textbook also features numerous exercises and unsolved problems. The essential introduction to discrete and computational geometry Covers traditional topics as well as new and advanced material Features numerous full-color illustrations, exercises, and unsolved problems Suitable for sophomores in mathematics, computer science, engineering, or physics Rigorous but accessible An online solutions manual is available (for teachers only).

To a working mathematician or computer scientist, it offers sophisticated results and techniques of great diversity and it is a foundation for fields such as computational geometry or combinatorial optimization.This book is primarily a textbook introduction to various areas of discrete geometry. In each area, it explains several key results and methods, in an accessible and concrete manner. It also contains more advanced material in separate sections and thus it can serve as a collection of surveys in several narrower subfields. The main topics include: basics on convex sets, convex polytopes, and hyperplane arrangements; combinatorial complexity of geometric configurations; intersection patterns and transversals of convex sets; geometric Ramsey-type results; polyhedral combinatorics and high-dimensional convexity; and lastly, embeddings of finite metric spaces into normed spaces.Jiri Matousek is Professor of Computer Science at Charles University in Prague. His research has contributed to several of the considered areas and to their algorithmic applications. This is his third book.},

	abstract = {What is the "most uniform" way of distributing n points in the unit square? How big is the "irregularity" necessarily present in any such distribution? Such questions are treated in geometric discrepancy theory. The book is an accessible and lively introduction to this area, with numerous exercises and illustrations. In separate, more specialized parts, it also provides a comprehensive guide to recent research. Including a wide variety of mathematical techniques (from harmonic analysis, combinatorics, algebra etc.) in action on non-trivial examples, the book is suitable for a "special topic" course for early graduates in mathematics and computer science. Besides professional mathematicians, it will be of interest to specialists in fields where a large collection of objects should be "uniformly" represented by a smaller sample (such as high-dimensional numerical integration in computational physics or financial mathematics, efficient divide-and-conquer algorithms in computer science, etc.). From the reviews: "...The numerous illustrations are well placed and instructive. The clear and elegant exposition conveys a wealth of intuitive insights into the techniques utilized. Each section usually consists of text, historical remarks and references for the specialist, and exercises. Hints are provided for the more difficult exercises, with the exercise-hint format permitting inclusion of more results than otherwise would be possible in a book of this size..." Allen D.

	abstract = {We use random sampling for several new geometric algorithms. The algorithms are “Las Vegas,” and their expected bounds are with respect to the random behavior of the algorithms. These algorithms follow from new general results giving sharp bounds for the use of random subsets in geometric algorithms. These bounds show that random subsets can be used optimally for divide-and-conquer, and also give bounds for a simple, general technique for building geometric structures incrementally. One new algorithm reports all the intersecting pairs of a set of line segments in the plane, and requiresO(A+n logn) expected time, whereA is the number of intersecting pairs reported. The algorithm requiresO(n) space in the worst case. Another algorithm computes the convex hull ofn points inEdinO(n logn) expected time ford=3, andO(n[d/2]) expected time ford{\textbackslash}textgreater3. The algorithm also gives fast expected times for random input points. Another algorithm computes the diameter of a set ofn points inE3 inO(n logn) expected time, and on the way computes the intersection ofn unit balls inE3. We show thatO(n logA) expected time suffices to compute the convex hull ofn points inE3, whereA is the number of input points on the surface of the hull. Algorithms for halfspace range reporting are also given. In addition, we give asymptotically tight bounds for (≤k)-sets, which are certain halfspace partitions of point sets, and give a simple proof of Lee's bounds for high-order Voronoi diagrams.},

The success of the ?eld as a research discipline can on the one hand be explained from the beauty of the problems studied and the solutions obtained, and, on the other hand, by the many application domains—computer graphics, geographic information systems (GIS), robotics, and others—in which geometric algorithms play a fundamental role. For many geometric problems the early algorithmic solutions were either slow or dif?cult to understand and implement. In recent years a number of new algorithmic techniques have been developed that improved and simpli?ed many of the previous approaches. In this textbook we have tried to make these modern algorithmic solutions accessible to a large audience.

Instead of the usual guards we consider wireless devices whose signal can cross a certain number, k, of walls. These devices are called k-transmitters. We propose an algorithm for constructing the visibility region of a k-transmitter located on a point of a simple polygon. Then we apply a hybrid metaheuristic strategy to tackle the problem of minimizing the number of k-transmitters, located at vertices, that cover a given simple polygon, and compare its performance with two pure metaheuristics. We conclude that the approximate solutions obtained with the hybrid strategy, for 2-transmitters and 4-transmitters, on simple polygons, monotone polygons, orthogonal polygons and monotone orthogonal polygons, are better than the solutions obtained with the pure strategies.},

A point in the interior of a polygon is “illuminated” by a [Formula: see text]-modem if the line segment joining them intersects at most [Formula: see text] edges of the polygon. It is easy to construct polygons of [Formula: see text] vertices where the number of [Formula: see text]-modems required to illuminate all interior points is [Formula: see text]. However, no non-trivial upper bound is known. In this paper we prove that the number of kmodems required to illuminate any polygon of [Formula: see text] vertices is [Formula: see text]. For the cases of illuminating an orthogonal polygon or a set of disjoint orthogonal segments, we give a tighter bound of [Formula: see text].

	abstract = {Discrete geometry is a relatively new development in pure mathematics, while computational geometry is an emerging area in applications-driven computer science. Their intermingling has yielded exciting advances in recent years, yet what has been lacking until now is an undergraduate textbook that bridges the gap between the two. Discrete and Computational Geometry offers a comprehensive yet accessible introduction to this cutting-edge frontier of mathematics and computer science. This book covers traditional topics such as convex hulls, triangulations, and Voronoi diagrams, as well as more recent subjects like pseudotriangulations, curve reconstruction, and locked chains. It also touches on more advanced material, including Dehn invariants, associahedra, quasigeodesics, Morse theory, and the recent resolution of the Poincaré conjecture. Connections to real-world applications are made throughout, and algorithms are presented independently of any programming language. This richly illustrated textbook also features numerous exercises and unsolved problems. The essential introduction to discrete and computational geometry Covers traditional topics as well as new and advanced material Features numerous full-color illustrations, exercises, and unsolved problems Suitable for sophomores in mathematics, computer science, engineering, or physics Rigorous but accessible An online solutions manual is available (for teachers only).

	abstract = {Discrete geometry investigates combinatorial properties of configurations of geometric objects. To a working mathematician or computer scientist, it offers sophisticated results and techniques of great diversity and it is a foundation for fields such as computational geometry or combinatorial optimization.This book is primarily a textbook introduction to various areas of discrete geometry. In each area, it explains several key results and methods, in an accessible and concrete manner. It also contains more advanced material in separate sections and thus it can serve as a collection of surveys in several narrower subfields. The main topics include: basics on convex sets, convex polytopes, and hyperplane arrangements; combinatorial complexity of geometric configurations; intersection patterns and transversals of convex sets; geometric Ramsey-type results; polyhedral combinatorics and high-dimensional convexity; and lastly, embeddings of finite metric spaces into normed spaces.Jiri Matousek is Professor of Computer Science at Charles University in Prague. His research has contributed to several of the considered areas and to their algorithmic applications. This is his third book.},

	abstract = {What is the "most uniform" way of distributing n points in the unit square? How big is the "irregularity" necessarily present in any such distribution? Such questions are treated in geometric discrepancy theory. The book is an accessible and lively introduction to this area, with numerous exercises and illustrations. In separate, more specialized parts, it also provides a comprehensive guide to recent research. Including a wide variety of mathematical techniques (from harmonic analysis, combinatorics, algebra etc.) in action on non-trivial examples, the book is suitable for a "special topic" course for early graduates in mathematics and computer science. Besides professional mathematicians, it will be of interest to specialists in fields where a large collection of objects should be "uniformly" represented by a smaller sample (such as high-dimensional numerical integration in computational physics or financial mathematics, efficient divide-and-conquer algorithms in computer science, etc.). From the reviews: "...The numerous illustrations are well placed and instructive. The clear and elegant exposition conveys a wealth of intuitive insights into the techniques utilized. Each section usually consists of text, historical remarks and references for the specialist, and exercises. Hints are provided for the more difficult exercises, with the exercise-hint format permitting inclusion of more results than otherwise would be possible in a book of this size..." Allen D.

The success of the ?eld as a research discipline can on the one hand be explained from the beauty of the problems studied and the solutions obtained, and, on the other hand, by the many application domains—computer graphics, geographic information systems (GIS), robotics, and others—in which geometric algorithms play a fundamental role. For many geometric problems the early algorithmic solutions were either slow or dif?cult to understand and implement. In recent years a number of new algorithmic techniques have been developed that improved and simpli?ed many of the previous approaches. In this textbook we have tried to make these modern algorithmic solutions accessible to a large audience.

	abstract = {We use random sampling for several new geometric algorithms. The algorithms are “Las Vegas,” and their expected bounds are with respect to the random behavior of the algorithms. These algorithms follow from new general results giving sharp bounds for the use of random subsets in geometric algorithms. These bounds show that random subsets can be used optimally for divide-and-conquer, and also give bounds for a simple, general technique for building geometric structures incrementally. One new algorithm reports all the intersecting pairs of a set of line segments in the plane, and requiresO(A+n logn) expected time, whereA is the number of intersecting pairs reported. The algorithm requiresO(n) space in the worst case. Another algorithm computes the convex hull ofn points inEdinO(n logn) expected time ford=3, andO(n[d/2]) expected time ford{\textbackslash}textgreater3. The algorithm also gives fast expected times for random input points. Another algorithm computes the diameter of a set ofn points inE3 inO(n logn) expected time, and on the way computes the intersection ofn unit balls inE3. We show thatO(n logA) expected time suffices to compute the convex hull ofn points inE3, whereA is the number of input points on the surface of the hull. Algorithms for halfspace range reporting are also given. In addition, we give asymptotically tight bounds for (≤k)-sets, which are certain halfspace partitions of point sets, and give a simple proof of Lee's bounds for high-order Voronoi diagrams.},

Instead of the usual guards we consider wireless devices whose signal can cross a certain number, k, of walls. These devices are called k-transmitters. We propose an algorithm for constructing the visibility region of a k-transmitter located on a point of a simple polygon. Then we apply a hybrid metaheuristic strategy to tackle the problem of minimizing the number of k-transmitters, located at vertices, that cover a given simple polygon, and compare its performance with two pure metaheuristics. We conclude that the approximate solutions obtained with the hybrid strategy, for 2-transmitters and 4-transmitters, on simple polygons, monotone polygons, orthogonal polygons and monotone orthogonal polygons, are better than the solutions obtained with the pure strategies.},

A point in the interior of a polygon is “illuminated” by a [Formula: see text]-modem if the line segment joining them intersects at most [Formula: see text] edges of the polygon. It is easy to construct polygons of [Formula: see text] vertices where the number of [Formula: see text]-modems required to illuminate all interior points is [Formula: see text]. However, no non-trivial upper bound is known. In this paper we prove that the number of kmodems required to illuminate any polygon of [Formula: see text] vertices is [Formula: see text].

Its explosive growth in recent years is mainly due to its role as an essential structure underpinning modern applied mathematics – computer science, combinatorial optimization, and operations research in particular – but also to its increasing application in the more applied sciences. The versatility of graphs makes them indispensable tools in the design and analysis of communication networks, for instance. The primary aim of this book is to present a coherent introduction to the subject, suitable as a textbook for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in mathematics and computer science. It provides a systematic treatment of the theory of graphs without sacrificing its intuitive and aesthetic appeal. Commonly used proof techniques are described and illustrated, and a wealth of exercises - of varying levels of difficulty - are provided to help the reader master the techniques and reinforce their grasp of the material. A second objective is to serve as an introduction to research in graph theory. To this end, sections on more advanced topics are included, and a number of interesting and challenging open problems are highlighted and discussed in some detail. Despite this more advanced material, the book has been organized in such a way that an introductory course on graph theory can be based on the first few sections of selected chapters.},

	abstract = {Computational geometry emerged from the ?eld of algorithms design and analysis in the late 1970s. It has grown into a recognized discipline with its own journals, conferences, and a large community of active researchers. The success of the ?eld as a research discipline can on the one hand be explained from the beauty of the problems studied and the solutions obtained, and, on the other hand, by the many application domains—computer graphics, geographic information systems (GIS), robotics, and others—in which geometric algorithms play a fundamental role. For many geometric problems the early algorithmic solutions were either slow or dif?cult to understand and implement. In recent years a number of new algorithmic techniques have been developed that improved and simpli?ed many of the previous approaches. In this textbook we have tried to make these modern algorithmic solutions accessible to a large audience. The book has been written as a textbook for a course in computational geometry, but it can also be used for self-study.},

	abstract = {We study the computational complexity of the art gallery problem originally posed by Klee, and its variations. Specifically, the problem of determining the minimum number of vertex guards that can see an n-wall simply connected art gallery is shown to be NP-hard. The proof can be modified to show that the problems of determining the minimum number of edge guards and the minimum number of point guards in a simply connected polygonal region are also NP-hard. As a byproduct, the problem of decomposing a simple polygon into a minimum number of star-shaped polygons such that their union is the original polygon is also shown to be NP-hard.},
