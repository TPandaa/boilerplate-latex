  abstract = {Consider a rectangular art gallery divide into n rectangular rooms, such that any two rooms sharing a wall in common have a door connecting them. How many guards need to be stationed in the gallery so as to protect all of the rooms in our gallery? Note that of a guard is stationed at a door, he will be able to guard two rooms. Our main aim in this paper is to show that ⌈n/2⌉ guards are always sufficient to protect all rooms in a rectangular art gallery. Extensions of our result are obtained for non-rectangular galleries and for 3-dimensional art galleries.},

  abstract  = {In 1973, Victor Klee posed the following question: How many guards are necessary, and how many are sufficient to patrol the paintings and works of art in an art gallery with n walls?This wonderfully naïve question of combinatorial geometry has, since its formulation, stimulated a plethora of fun papers, surveys and a book, most of them written in the last twentyfive years. Several variations of the original Art Gallery Problem have appeared, and continue to appear in the literature. In this talk, we will present some recent work motivated by the following problem.Experience dictates that while trying to locate the best location for a wireless within a building, the main factor that attenuates the signal of a wireless modem, is the number of walls that a signal has to cross. Thus we call a wireless modem (from now on a modem) a k-modem if the signal it transmits is capable of crossing k-walls of a building, and still provide a strong enough signal.A generalization of Klee’s question is thus: How many k-modems are necessary, and how many are sufficient to cover the interior of an art gallery with n-walls? For k = 0, our problem reduces to the original Art Gallery Problem.},

Their intermingling has yielded exciting advances in recent years, yet what has been lacking until now is an undergraduate textbook that bridges the gap between the two. Discrete and Computational Geometry offers a comprehensive yet accessible introduction to this cutting-edge frontier of mathematics and computer science. This book covers traditional topics such as convex hulls, triangulations, and Voronoi diagrams, as well as more recent subjects like pseudotriangulations, curve reconstruction, and locked chains. It also touches on more advanced material, including Dehn invariants, associahedra, quasigeodesics, Morse theory, and the recent resolution of the Poincaré conjecture. Connections to real-world applications are made throughout, and algorithms are presented independently of any programming language. This richly illustrated textbook also features numerous exercises and unsolved problems. The essential introduction to discrete and computational geometry Covers traditional topics as well as new and advanced material Features numerous full-color illustrations, exercises, and unsolved problems Suitable for sophomores in mathematics, computer science, engineering, or physics Rigorous but accessible An online solutions manual is available (for teachers only).

Such questions are treated in geometric discrepancy theory. The book is an accessible and lively introduction to this area, with numerous exercises and illustrations. In separate, more specialized parts, it also provides a comprehensive guide to recent research. Including a wide variety of mathematical techniques (from harmonic analysis, combinatorics, algebra etc.) in action on non-trivial examples, the book is suitable for a "special topic" course for early graduates in mathematics and computer science. Besides professional mathematicians, it will be of interest to specialists in fields where a large collection of objects should be "uniformly" represented by a smaller sample (such as high-dimensional numerical integration in computational physics or financial mathematics, efficient divide-and-conquer algorithms in computer science, etc.). From the reviews: "...The numerous illustrations are well placed and instructive. The clear and elegant exposition conveys a wealth of intuitive insights into the techniques utilized. Each section usually consists of text, historical remarks and references for the specialist, and exercises. Hints are provided for the more difficult exercises, with the exercise-hint format permitting inclusion of more results than otherwise would be possible in a book of this size..." Allen D.

  abstract = {We use random sampling for several new geometric algorithms. The algorithms are “Las Vegas,” and their expected bounds are with respect to the random behavior of the algorithms. These algorithms follow from new general results giving sharp bounds for the use of random subsets in geometric algorithms. These bounds show that random subsets can be used optimally for divide-and-conquer, and also give bounds for a simple, general technique for building geometric structures incrementally. One new algorithm reports all the intersecting pairs of a set of line segments in the plane, and requiresO(A+n logn) expected time, whereA is the number of intersecting pairs reported. The algorithm requiresO(n) space in the worst case. Another algorithm computes the convex hull ofn points inEdinO(n logn) expected time ford=3, andO(n[d/2]) expected time ford{\textbackslash}textgreater3. The algorithm also gives fast expected times for random input points. Another algorithm computes the diameter of a set ofn points inE3 inO(n logn) expected time, and on the way computes the intersection ofn unit balls inE3. We show thatO(n logA) expected time suffices to compute the convex hull ofn points inE3, whereA is the number of input points on the surface of the hull. Algorithms for halfspace range reporting are also given. In addition, we give asymptotically tight bounds for (≤k)-sets, which are certain halfspace partitions of point sets, and give a simple proof of Lee's bounds for high-order Voronoi diagrams.},

  abstract   = {Computational geometry emerged from the ?eld of algorithms design and analysis in the late 1970s. It has grown into a recognized discipline with its own journals, conferences, and a large community of active researchers. The success of the ?eld as a research discipline can on the one hand be explained from the beauty of the problems studied and the solutions obtained, and, on the other hand, by the many application domains—computer graphics, geographic information systems (GIS), robotics, and others—in which geometric algorithms play a fundamental role. For many geometric problems the early algorithmic solutions were either slow or dif?cult to understand and implement. In recent years a number of new algorithmic techniques have been developed that improved and simpli?ed many of the previous approaches. In this textbook we have tried to make these modern algorithmic solutions accessible to a large audience. The book has been written as a textbook for a course in computational geometry, but it can also be used for self-study.},

Instead of modeling a light source we model a wireless device whose radio signal can penetrate a given number \$k\$ of walls.

We show that every monotone polygon with \$n\$ vertices can be illuminated with \${\textbackslash}textbackslashbig{\textbackslash}textbackslashlceil {\textbackslash}textbackslashfrac\{n-2\}\{2k+3\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashbig{\textbackslash}textbackslashrceil\$ \$k\$-modems.

For monotone orthogonal polygons with \$n\$ vertices we show that for \$k=1\$ and for even \$k\$, every such polygon can be illuminated with \${\textbackslash}textbackslashbig{\textbackslash}textbackslashlceil {\textbackslash}textbackslashfrac\{n-2\}\{2k+4\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashbig{\textbackslash}textbackslashrceil\$ \$k\$-modems, while for odd \$k{\textbackslash}textbackslashgeq3\$, \${\textbackslash}textbackslashbig{\textbackslash}textbackslashlceil {\textbackslash}textbackslashfrac\{n-2\}\{2k+6\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashbig{\textbackslash}textbackslashrceil\$ \$k\$-modems are always sufficient.

Instead of the usual guards we consider wireless devices whose signal can cross a certain number, k, of walls. These devices are called k-transmitters. We propose an algorithm for constructing the visibility region of a k-transmitter located on a point of a simple polygon. Then we apply a hybrid metaheuristic strategy to tackle the problem of minimizing the number of k-transmitters, located at vertices, that cover a given simple polygon, and compare its performance with two pure metaheuristics. We conclude that the approximate solutions obtained with the hybrid strategy, for 2-transmitters and 4-transmitters, on simple polygons, monotone polygons, orthogonal polygons and monotone orthogonal polygons, are better than the solutions obtained with the pure strategies.},

In this variant light sources are replaced by wireless devices called [Formula: see text]-modems, which can penetrate a fixed number [Formula: see text], of “walls”. A point in the interior of a polygon is “illuminated” by a [Formula: see text]-modem if the line segment joining them intersects at most [Formula: see text] edges of the polygon. It is easy to construct polygons of [Formula: see text] vertices where the number of [Formula: see text]-modems required to illuminate all interior points is [Formula: see text]. However, no non-trivial upper bound is known. In this paper we prove that the number of kmodems required to illuminate any polygon of [Formula: see text] vertices is [Formula: see text]. For the cases of illuminating an orthogonal polygon or a set of disjoint orthogonal segments, we give a tighter bound of [Formula: see text]. Moreover, we present an [Formula: see text] time algorithm to achieve this bound.},

It also touches on more advanced material, including Dehn invariants, associahedra, quasigeodesics, Morse theory, and the recent resolution of the Poincaré conjecture. Connections to real-world applications are made throughout, and algorithms are presented independently of any programming language. This richly illustrated textbook also features numerous exercises and unsolved problems.

In separate, more specialized parts, it also provides a comprehensive guide to recent research. Including a wide variety of mathematical techniques (from harmonic analysis, combinatorics, algebra etc.) in action on non-trivial examples, the book is suitable for a "special topic" course for early graduates in mathematics and computer science. Besides professional mathematicians, it will be of interest to specialists in fields where a large collection of objects should be "uniformly" represented by a smaller sample (such as high-dimensional numerical integration in computational physics or financial mathematics, efficient divide-and-conquer algorithms in computer science, etc.). From the reviews: "...The numerous illustrations are well placed and instructive. The clear and elegant exposition conveys a wealth of intuitive insights into the techniques utilized. Each section usually consists of text, historical remarks and references for the specialist, and exercises. Hints are provided for the more difficult exercises, with the exercise-hint format permitting inclusion of more results than otherwise would be possible in a book of this size..." Allen D.

  abstract   = {Concepts taken from graph theory and other branches of topology have been used by many sociologists and social psychologists, in particular Kurt Lewin and J. L. Moreno. Similar ideas have been used to construct statistical models of nervous systems, and these have been applied by J. S. Coleman and others to the spread of information and other social phenomena. The study of social networks by anthropologists has been based, knowingly or unknowingly, on the basic notions of graph theory, as has the identification and analysis of social cliques. There is little consensus among mathematicians about terminology, and social scientists have drawn fortuitously on various mathematical vocabularies as well as inventing their own technical terms. Applied to social networks, the words `connectedness' and `connectivity' may refer to properties of the distance between persons, the number of paths between them, whether there is a path at all, or the proportion of possible paths actually in existence. These different usages are contrasted by restating them all in the terminology set out in Structural models (1965) by Harary, Norman and Cartwright.},

  abstract  = {Assume that n directional antennae located at distinct points in the plane are rotating at constant identical speeds. They all have identical range and sensor angle (or field of view). We propose and study the Rotating Antennae Coverage Problem, a new problem concerning rotating sensors for the uninterrupted coverage of a region in the plane. More specifically, what is the initial orientation of the sensors, minimum angle, and range required so that a given (infinite or finite) line or planar domain is covered by the rotating sensors at all times? We give algorithms for determining the initial orientation of the sensors and analyze the resulting angle/range tradeoffs for ensuring continuous coverage of a given region or line in the plane with identical rotating sensors of given transmission angle and range. We also investigate other variants of the problem whereby for a given parameter T (representing time) there is no point in the domain that is left unattended by some sensor for a period of time longer than T. Despite the apparent simplicity of the problem several of the algorithms proposed are intricate and elegant. We have also implemented our algorithms in C++ and the code can be downloaded on the web.},
